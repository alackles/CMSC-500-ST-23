This is a rough schedule of topics for each day, and the release and due dates for homework assignments. Dates and topics are subject to change. 

All reading is due **before** class time on that day. "Perusall" means there will be 1 to 3 short readings on Persuall for that day. All readings (including papers) will be posted to Perusall. 

Instructions for paper discussions are [here](https://alackles.github.io/CMSC-500-ST-23/papers/instructions).

Code for the course is [here](https://github.com/alackles/CMSC-500-ST-23/tree/main/code).
